Capstone Project 2 (+CSS)

Add Bootstrap to your project (via CDN link in your <head>).
Redesign or enhance at least one of your existing pages (e.g., Home, Education, Gallery, or Contact) using Bootstrap classes.
Use at least:
A Bootstrap grid system (rows + columns).
At least one Bootstrap component (e.g., buttons, navbar, card, form).
A Bootstrap utility class (e.g., spacing, text alignment, background color).
Compare the Bootstrap version of your page with the custom CSS version:
What did Bootstrap make easier?
What was harder or more restrictive?

Part 6: Deployment & Documentation

Create a README.md file in your repository.
The README must briefly describe:
What you have done in this project
What you learned while doing it
What the purpose of the website is (personal page, practice project, portfolio, etc.)
Push your updated project to GitHub on top of your previous Capstone (do not delete the old history).
Re-deploy your website using GitHub Pages, overwriting the previous version.
Share the new live link with the others, get their feedback and further improve it.
